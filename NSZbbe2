on the mountain
there is a beautiful girl
she is lonely there
in a prison
she can sing all day

there is a big tree
at her Window
and the birds on the tree
can hear her beautiful voice all day long

she could not see her prince
because he is far far away
she is sad and so he is
so every bird will help them to meet

at fullmoon they have power
and they give it to the girl
and with this power
she can escape from the prison

she can have dress from the tree
to dance at night with the prince
they dance all night long
and the prince did give her the flower

the girl was very happy
but she did go back
to give back the power to every bird
but her shoe did fall Down

the prince did find her
he did help to escape
and now they live together
and every bird will live there

and if they need power
they wait for the fullmoon.
