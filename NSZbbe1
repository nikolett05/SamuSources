in a big deep forest
there is a lazy animal
his name is Funny
because he is funny

he can count from
one to ten
but with a lot of mistake
and it is so funny

one day Funny who is a bird
could not sleep at night
because he is afraid of the dark
and the forest is dark at day and night

his friend is a deer
when he is there
the bunny is fine
so they play all day and night

they eat sleep talk play
like there is no problem
one day a prince is there on a horse
they never did see man before

the prince is in the
dark forest to find
a beautiful flower
to a beautiful girl

the bird did show him
the most beautiful flower
in the forest so
he did tell the sun
to always shine

now there is always sunny
so Funny and the deer are happy.
