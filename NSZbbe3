the prince and the girl
now are happy
and have a baby
her name is Hope

because they know
there is always hope

this is her first birthday
and i think you know
it is fullmoon
so this will be a sweet surprise

every bird did give
the power to the baby
and when Hope will grow up
she will have all the power

when she did grow up
she did use the power
to make everyone happy
and friendly

soon a prince did come
to the city
to give something in return
for the peace and happiness

she did not want
anything in return
but she did fall in love
with the prince

and the prince also
did fall in love
with the beautiful Hope...
i hope you know what is the end...
